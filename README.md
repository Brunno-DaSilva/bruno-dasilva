### Application Development:


I decided to dig in React Springs and React Ant, to challenge myself to learn something new while re-branding and re-creating my portfolio. Among many challenges, understanding the core concept of React Springs was, without a shadow of doubt one of the most difficult aspects, however, once I started it was so addictive that I had to control myself and not animate every single portion of my site.
