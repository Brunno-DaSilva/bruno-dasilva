### Application Development:

My goal since the beginning was to provide a simplistic layout with a modern responsive design to it. So, I decided to go for a wide overflow hidden layout, like a canvas style, where I could focus on the user experience providing the users free form distractions and a clean layout approach.

The dark mode was one of my goals and with the UseState hook it made my life super easy where I could setDarkMode based on conditional rendering. 

I decided to dig in React Springs and React in general, in order to challenge myself and learn something new while re-branding and re-creating my portfolio. 

Among many challenges, understanding the core concept of React Springs was, without a shadow of doubt one of the most difficult aspects, however, once I started it was so addictive that I had to control myself and not animate every single portion of my site. My favorite part was a was the Tree menu that I used to display my Resume information in the About me sections.
